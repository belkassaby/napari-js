# Changelog

All notable changes to napari-js are documented here. The format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- **Runtime control toggle** — `Viewer.setControlsEnabled(enabled)` and the `controlsActive`
  getter attach/detach the pointer pan/zoom (2D) and orbit (3D) controls on demand. A host can
  disable navigation so it owns the pointer for region drawing (rectangle/polygon/lasso), then
  re-enable it to restore navigation. The `controls` constructor option is now toggleable at
  runtime rather than fixed at construction.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **3D camera drag modes** — `Camera3D.dragMode` (`'rotate'` | `'pan'` | `'zoom'`) plus
  `Camera3D.pan(dx, dy, viewportHeight)`; the orbit controls branch a pointer drag accordingly
  (the wheel still always dollies). `Viewer.setCameraDragMode(mode)` lets a host switch it
  (e.g. orbit / pan / zoom toolbar buttons). Enables interactive volume navigation beyond
  orbit-only.

## [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Documentation: README adds a Features list and a library Install/Use example, and references
  the originating issue [jit-ui#102](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/jit-ui/issues/102);
  `docs/06` links the tracking issue and marks Phase C underway. (No code changes.)

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Device-loss recovery** — on `GPUDevice.lost` (GPU reset/driver crash), the viewer
  re-acquires a device and rebuilds the canvas target, renderer, and all layer textures.
- **uint16 / uint32 labels** — `LabelsLayer` / `Viewer.addLabels` accept
  `Uint8Array | Uint16Array | Uint32Array`; ids are stored in an `r32uint` texture and
  integer-fetched (`textureLoad`), so label ids > 255 render correctly.
- **`ImageBitmap` tile chunks** — `TiledSource.fetchTile` may return a decoded `ImageBitmap`
  (e.g. a PNG tile from a server), uploaded via `copyExternalImageToTexture`.
- **Per-channel native histogram** — `Viewer.layerHistogram(layer, bins)` computes a
  histogram from a single-channel image layer's in-memory source at native bit depth, plus a
  pure `histogramScalar()` helper.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Host-embedding APIs: `Viewer.worldToCanvas()`, `Viewer.visibleWorldRect()`, and optional
  `ResizeObserver` auto-resize (`autoResize` option).
- Multi-demo playground with a dropdown selector (image, multi-channel, tiled + z-stack,
  points + labels, volume) for browser verification.
- Coverage tooling (`npm run test:coverage`) and expanded unit tests.
- `docs/08` — landscape & related work (how napari-js differs from Viv/vizarr and the
  Python-in-browser napari direction).

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release. Phase B milestones NJ-0…NJ-5+: WebGPU image rendering
  (single / multi-channel / 16-bit / float32), tiled + pyramidal large images with z-stacks,
  points (SDF markers), labels, and 3D volume raymarching (MIP / translucent / iso), plus
  pixel readback, screenshot, and histogram. Tag-triggered CI/CD publishes to npm with
  provenance.
