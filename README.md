# napari-js

A browser-native, **WebGPU** rendering engine that ports the visualization model of
[napari](https://napari.org) (the Python multi-dimensional image viewer) to TypeScript.

> **Status:** **NJ-3 complete** — tiled/pyramidal large images + z-stacks. A `TiledSource`
> (`fetchTile(level,col,row,z)`) renders multi-gigapixel images via level-of-detail
> selection, an LRU GPU-tile cache, a coarse base underlay (no blank flashes), and async
> progressive loading; a `Dims` model drives z-scrubbing (slices cached by z). Builds on
> NJ-1/NJ-2 (model, `image-colormap` pipeline, multi-channel + 16-bit). Pure pyramid/LRU/dims
> logic is unit-tested. All gates green (typecheck / lint / 57 unit tests / build). Next:
> **NJ-4** — pixel readback, screenshot, histogram, and the v0.1 npm publish. See the
> [roadmap](./docs/05-roadmap.md); design rationale lives in [`docs/`](./docs).

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # open the printed URL in a WebGPU browser → see the demo quad
npm test           # GPU-free unit tests (Vitest)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run build      # library bundle + types → dist/
```

`npm run dev` serves `index.html` → `playground/main.ts`, which creates a `Viewer`, awaits
its WebGPU device, and renders the NJ-0 demo. If WebGPU is unavailable the page shows the
reason instead of crashing.

## What this is

napari-js is a **standalone, framework-agnostic** library. It renders large
multi-dimensional / multi-channel scientific images in the browser on the GPU, with
napari's model: a `Viewer` holding a list of `Layer`s (Image, later Points / Labels /
Volume), each with its own colormap (LUT), contrast limits, gamma, opacity, and blending.

It is **not** a port of napari's Python code or its Qt GUI. It is a faithful port of
napari's *rendering concepts* — the layer→visual model, per-layer GPU colormapping,
serializable transforms and camera — onto WebGPU and WGSL. See
[`docs/07-napari-concept-mapping.md`](./docs/07-napari-concept-mapping.md).

## Why

WebGPU now ships in all major browsers (late 2025). napari's strengths — GPU
multi-channel fluorescence compositing, live scalar colormapping, and volume rendering —
are exactly the things current browser image viewers do poorly or on the CPU. napari-js
brings those strengths to the web as a reusable npm package.

## Where it fits

```
~/git/napari      Reference: the Python renderer being ported (napari/_vispy, layers, components)
~/git/napari-js   THIS repo: the standalone TS + WebGPU port, published to npm
~/git/jit-ui      Eventual consumer: jax-image-visualization adds a napari-js IVisualizer backend
```

The first downstream consumer will be the `jax-image-visualization` library in the
`jit-ui` monorepo, which will add napari-js as a new `IVisualizer` backend alongside its
OpenSeadragon and Plotly backends. **That integration is a later phase** (see
[`docs/06-jit-ui-integration.md`](./docs/06-jit-ui-integration.md)); napari-js is built
and published independently first.
